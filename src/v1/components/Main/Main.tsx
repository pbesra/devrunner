				Meta Platforms, Inc.,[10] doing business as Meta,[11] and
				formerly named Facebook, Inc., and TheFacebook, Inc.,[12][13] is
				an American multinational technology conglomerate based in Menlo
				Park, California. The company owns and operates Facebook,
				Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and
				services.[14] Advertising accounts for 97.8 percent of its
				revenue.[a][15] Originally known as the parent company of the
				Facebook service, as Facebook, Inc., it was rebranded to its
				current name in 2021 to "reflect its focus on building the
				metaverse",[16] an integrated environment linking the company's
				products and services.[17][18][19] Meta ranks among the largest
				American information technology companies, alongside other Big
				Five corporations Alphabet (Google), Amazon, Apple, and
				Microsoft. The company was ranked #31 on the Forbes Global 2000
				ranking in 2023.[20] In 2022, Meta was the company with the
				third-highest expenditure on research and development worldwide,
				with R&D expenditure amounting to US$35.3 billion.[21] Meta has
				also acquired Oculus (which it has integrated into Reality
				Labs), Mapillary, CTRL-Labs, and a 9.99% stake in Jio Platforms;
				the company additionally endeavored into non-VR hardware, such
				as the discontinued Meta Portal smart displays line and partners
				with Luxottica through the Ray-Ban Stories series of
				smartglasses.[22][23] History Further information: History of

				Criticism Litigation Related vte Facebook filed for an initial
				public offering (IPO) on January 1, 2012.[24] The preliminary
				prospectus stated that the company sought to raise $5 billion,
				had 845 million monthly active users, and a website accruing 2.7
				billion likes and comments daily.[25] After the IPO, Zuckerberg
				would retain 22% of the total shares and 57% of the total voting
				power in Facebook.[26] Underwriters valued the shares at $38
				each, valuing the company at $104 billion, the largest valuation
				yet for a newly public company.[27] On May 16, one day before
				the IPO, Facebook announced it would sell 25% more shares than
				originally planned due to high demand.[28] The IPO raised $16
				billion, making it the third-largest in US history (slightly
				ahead of AT&T Mobility and behind only General Motors and Visa).
				The stock price left the company with a higher market
				capitalization than all but a few U.S. corporations—surpassing
				heavyweights such as Amazon, McDonald's, Disney, and Kraft
				Foods—and made Zuckerberg's stock worth $19 billion.[29][30] The
				New York Times stated that the offering overcame questions about
				Facebook's difficulties in attracting advertisers to transform
				the company into a "must-own stock". Jimmy Lee of JPMorgan Chase
				described it as "the next great blue-chip".[29] Writers at
				TechCrunch, on the other hand, expressed skepticism, stating,
				"That's a big multiple to live up to, and Facebook will likely
				need to add bold new revenue streams to justify the mammoth
				valuation."[31] Trading in the stock, which began on May 18, was
				delayed that day due to technical problems with the Nasdaq
				exchange.[32] The stock struggled to stay above the IPO price
				for most of the day, forcing underwriters to buy back shares to
				support the price.[33] At the closing bell, shares were valued
				at $38.23,[34] only $0.23 above the IPO price and down $3.82
				from the opening bell value. The opening was widely described by
				the financial press as a disappointment.[35] The stock
				nonetheless set a new record for trading volume of an IPO.[36]
				On May 25, 2012, the stock ended its first full week of trading
				at $31.91, a 16.5% decline.[37] On May 22, 2012, regulators from
				Wall Street's Financial Industry Regulatory Authority announced
				that they had begun to investigate whether banks underwriting
				Facebook had improperly shared information only with select
				clients rather than the general public. Massachusetts Secretary
				of State William F. Galvin subpoenaed Morgan Stanley over the
				same issue.[38] The allegations sparked "fury" among some
				investors and led to the immediate filing of several lawsuits,
				one of them a class action suit claiming more than $2.5 billion
				in losses due to the IPO.[39] Bloomberg estimated that retail
				investors may have lost approximately $630 million on Facebook
				stock since its debut.[40] S&P Global Ratings added Facebook to
				its S&P 500 index on December 21, 2013.[41] On May 2, 2014,
				Zuckerberg announced that the company would be changing its
				internal motto from "Move fast and break things" to "Move fast
				with stable infrastructure".[42][43] The earlier motto had been
				described as Zuckerberg's "prime directive to his developers and
				team" in a 2009 interview in Business Insider, in which he also
				said, "Unless you are breaking stuff, you are not moving fast
				enough."[44] 2018–2020: Focus on the metaverse Lasso was a
				short-video sharing app from Facebook similar to TikTok that was
				launched on iOS and Android in 2018 and was aimed at teenagers.
				On July 2, 2020, Facebook announced that Lasso would be shutting
				down on July 10.[45][46][47] In 2018, the Oculus lead Jason
				Rubin sent his 50-page vision document titled "The Metaverse" to
				Facebook's leadership. In the document, Rubin acknowledged that
				Facebook's virtual reality business had not caught on as
				expected, despite the hundreds of millions of dollars spent on
				content for early adopters. He also urged the company to execute
				fast and invest heavily in the vision, to shut out HTC, Apple,
				Google and other competitors in the VR space. Regarding other
				players' participation in the metaverse vision, he called for
				the company to build the "metaverse" to prevent their
				competitors from "being in the VR business in a meaningful way
				at all".[48] In May 2019, Facebook founded Libra Networks,
				reportedly to develop their own stablecoin cryptocurrency.[49]
				Later, it was reported that Libra was being supported by
				financial companies such as Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and Uber.
				The consortium of companies was expected to pool in $10 million
				each to fund the launch of the cryptocurrency coin named
				Libra.[50] Depending on when it would receive approval from the
				Swiss Financial Market Supervisory authority to operate as a
				payments service, the Libra Association had planned to launch a
				limited format cryptocurrency in 2021.[51] Libra was renamed
				Diem, before being shut down and sold in January 2022 after
				backlash from Swiss government regulators and the
				public.[52][53] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the use of online
				services including Facebook grew globally.[54] Zuckerberg
				predicted this would be a "permanent acceleration" that would
				continue after the pandemic. Facebook hired aggressively,
				growing from 48,268 employees in March 2020 to more than 87,000
				by September 2022.[54] 2021: Rebrand as Meta Further
				information: Criticism of Facebook, Instagram § Impact on
				people, 2021 Facebook leak, and Frances Haugen See also:
				Facebook–Cambridge Analytica data scandal and 2020 Facebook ad
				boycotts Following a period of intense scrutiny and damaging
				whistleblower leaks, news started to emerge on October 21, 2021,
				about Facebook's plan to rebrand the company and change its
				name.[55][56] In the Q3 2021 Earnings Call on October 25, Mark
				Zuckerberg discussed the ongoing criticism of the company's
				social services and the way it operates, and pointed to the
				pivoting efforts to building the metaverse – without mentioning
				the rebranding and the name change.[57] The metaverse vision and
				the name change from Facebook, Inc. to Meta Platforms was
				introduced at Facebook Connect on October 28, 2021.[58] Based on
				Facebook's PR campaign, the name change reflects the company's
				shifting long term focus of building the metaverse, a digital
				extension of the physical world by social media, virtual reality
				and augmented reality features.[58][59] "Meta" had been
				registered as a trademark in the United States in 2018 (after an
				initial filing in 2015) for marketing, advertising, and computer
				services, by a Canadian company that provided big data analysis
				of scientific literature.[60] This company was acquired in 2017
				by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), a foundation
				established by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, and
				became one of their projects.[61] Following the rebranding
				announcement, CZI announced that it had already decided to
				deprioritize the earlier Meta project, thus it would be
				transferring its rights to the name to Meta Platforms, and the
				previous project would end in 2022.[62] 2022: Declining profits
				and mass layoffs Soon after the rebranding, in early February
				2022, Meta reported a greater-than-expected decline in profits
				in the fourth quarter of 2021.[63] It reported no growth in
				monthly users,[64] and indicated it expected revenue growth to
				stall.[63] It also expected measures taken by Apple Inc. to
				protect user privacy to cost it some $10 billion in
				advertisement revenue, an amount equal to roughly 8% of its
				revenue for 2021.[65] In meeting with Meta staff the day after
				earnings were reported, Zuckerberg blamed competition for user
				attention, particularly from video-based apps such as
				TikTok.[66] The 27% reduction in the company's share price which
				occurred in reaction to the news eliminated some $230 billion of
				value from Meta's market capitalization.[67] Bloomberg described
				the decline as "an epic rout that, in its sheer scale, is unlike
				anything Wall Street or Silicon Valley has ever seen".[67]
				Zuckerberg's net worth fell by as much as $31 billion.[68]
				Zuckerberg owns 13% of Meta, and the holding makes up the bulk
				of his wealth.[69][70] According to published reports by
				Bloomberg on March 30, 2022, Meta turned over data such as phone
				numbers, physical addresses, and IP addresses to hackers posing
				as law enforcement officials using forged documents. The law
				enforcement requests sometimes included forged signatures of
				real or fictional officials. When asked about the allegations, a
				Meta representative said, "We review every data request for
				legal sufficiency and use advanced systems and processes to
				validate law enforcement requests and detect abuse."[71] In June
				2022, Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of 14 years,
				announced she would step down that year. Zuckerberg said that
				Javier Olivan would replace Sandberg, though in a "more
				traditional" role.[72] In March 2022, Meta (except Meta-owned
				WhatsApp) and Instagram were banned in Russia and added to
				Russian list of terrorist and extremist organizations for
				alleged Russophobia and hate speech (up to genocidal calls) amid
				ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine.[73] Meta appealed against
				the ban but it was upheld by a Moscow court in June of the same
				year.[73] Also in March 2022, Meta and Italian eyewear giant
				Luxottica released Ray-Ban Stories, a series of smartglasses
				which could play music and take pictures. Meta and Luxottica
				parent company EssilorLuxottica declined to disclose sales on
				the line of products as of September 2022, though Meta has
				expressed satisfaction with its customer feedback.[23][74][75]
				In July 2022, Meta saw its first year-on-year revenue decline
				when its total revenue slipped by 1% to $28.8bn.[76] Analysts
				and journalists accredited the loss to its advertising business,
				which has been limited by Apple's app tracking transparency
				feature and the number of people who have opted not to be
				tracked by Meta apps. Zuckerberg also accredited the decline to
				increasing competition from TikTok.[77][78][79] On October 27,
				2022, Meta's market value dropped to $268 billion, a loss of
				around $700 billion compared to 2021, and its shares fell by
				24%. It lost its spot among the top 20 US companies by market
				cap, despite reaching the top 5 in the previous year.[80] In
				November 2022, Meta laid off 11,000 employees, 13% of its
				workforce. Zuckerberg said the decision to aggressively increase
				Meta's investments had been a mistake, as he had wrongly
				predicted that the surge in e-commerce would last beyond the
				COVID-19 pandemic. He also attributed the decline to increased
				competition, a global economic downturn and "ads signal
				loss".[81] Plans to lay off a further 10,000 employees began in
				April 2023.[82] The layoffs were part of a general downturn in
				the technology industry, alongside layoffs by companies
				including Google, Amazon, Tesla, Snap, Twitter and Lyft.[83][84]
				Starting from 2022, Meta scrambled to catch up to other tech
				companies in adopting specialised artificial intelligence
				hardware and software. It had been using less expensive CPUs
				instead of GPUs for AI work, but that approach turned out to be
				less efficient.[85] Since 2023: Threads, AI and all-time high
				stock value In 2023, Ireland's Data Protection Commissioner
				imposed record EUR 1.2 billion fine on Meta for transferring
				data from Europe to the United States without adequate
				protections for EU citizens.[86]: 250  In March 2023, Meta
				announced a new round of layoffs that would cut 10,000 employees
				and close 5,000 open positions in order to make the company more
				efficient.[87] Meta revenue surpassed analyst expectations for
				the first quarter of 2023 after announcing that it was
				increasing its focus on AI.[88] On July 6, Meta launched a new
				app, Threads, a competitor to Twitter.[89] Meta announced its
				artificial intelligence model Llama 2 in July 2023, available
				for commercial use via partnerships with major cloud providers
				like Microsoft. It was the first project to be unveiled out of
				Meta's generative AI group after it was set up in February. It
				would not charge access or usage but instead operate with an
				open-source model to allow Meta to ascertain what improvements
				need to be made. Prior to this announcement, Meta said it had no
				plans to release Llama 2 for commercial use. An earlier version
				of Llama was released to academics.[90][91] In August 2023, Meta
				announced its permanent removal of news content from Facebook
				and Instagram in Canada due to the Online News Act, which
				requires Canadian news outlets to be compensated for content
				shared on its platform. The Online News Act was in effect by
				year-end, but Meta will not participate in the regulatory
				process.[92] In October 2023, Zuckerberg said that AI would be
				Meta's biggest investment area in 2024.[93] Meta finished 2023
				as one of the best-performing technology stocks of the year,
				with its share price up 150 percent.[94] Its stock reached an
				all-time high in January 2024, bringing Meta within 2% of
				achieving $1 trillion market capitalization.[95] Meta Platforms
				launched an ad-free service in Europe in November 2023, allowing
				subscribers to opt-out of personal data being collected for
				targeted advertising. A group of 28 European organizations,
				including Max Schrems' advocacy group NOYB, the Irish Council
				for Civil Liberties, Wikimedia Europe, and the Electronic
				Privacy Information Center, signed a 2024 letter to the European
				Data Protection Board (EDPB) expressing concern that this
				subscriber model would undermine privacy protections,
				specifically GDPR data protection standards.[96] Meta removed
				the Facebook and Instagram accounts of Iran's Supreme Leader Ali
				Khamenei in February 2024, citing repeated violations of its
				Dangerous Organizations & Individuals policy.[97] As of March,
				Meta was under the investigation of the FDA for alleged use of
				their social media platforms to sell illegal drugs.[98] On 16
				May 2024, the European Commission began an investigation into
				Meta over concerns related to child safety.[99][100][101][102]
				In May 2023, Iraqi social media influencer Esaa Ahmed-Adnan
				encountered a troubling issue when Instagram removed his posts,
				citing false copyright violations despite his content being
				original and free from copyrighted material. He discovered that
				extortionists were behind these takedowns, offering to restore
				his content for $3,000 or provide ongoing protection for $1,000
				per month. This scam, exploiting Meta’s rights management tools,
				became widespread in the Middle East, revealing a gap in Meta’s
				enforcement in developing regions. An Iraqi nonprofit
				Tech4Peace’s founder, Aws al-Saadi helped Ahmed-Adnan and
				others, but the restoration process was slow, leading to
				significant financial losses for many victims, including
				prominent figures like Ammar al-Hakim. This situation
				highlighted Meta’s challenges in balancing global growth with
				effective content moderation and protection.[103] On 16
				September 2024, Meta announced it had banned Russian state media
				outlets from its platforms worldwide due to concerns about
				"foreign interference activity." This decision followed
				allegations that RT and its employees funneled $10 million
				through shell companies to secretly fund influence campaigns on
				various social media channels. Meta's actions were part of a
				broader effort to counter Russian covert influence operations,
				which had intensified since the invasion.[104] At its 2024
				Connect conference, Meta presented Orion,[105] its first pair of
				augmented reality glasses. Though Orion was originally intended
				to be sold to consumers, the manufacturing process turned out to
				be too complex and expensive.[106] Instead, the company pivoted
				to producing a small number of the glasses to be used
				internally.[107] On 4 October 2024, Meta announced about its new
				AI model called Movie Gen, capable of generating realistic video
				and audio clips based on user prompts. Meta stated it would not
				release Movie Gen for open development, preferring to
				collaborate directly with content creators and integrate it into
				its products by the following year. The model was built using a
				combination of licensed and publicly available datasets.[108] On
				October 31, 2024, ProPublica published an investigation into
				deceptive political advertisement scams that sometimes use
				hundreds of hijacked profiles and facebook pages run by
				organized networks of scammers. The authors cited spotty
				enforcement by Meta as a major reason for the extent of the
				issue.[109] Mergers and acquisitions For a more comprehensive
				list, see List of mergers and acquisitions by Meta Platforms.
				Meta has acquired multiple companies (often identified as talent
				acquisitions).[110] One of its first major acquisitions was in
				April 2012, when it acquired Instagram for approximately US$1
				billion in cash and stock.[111] In October 2013, Facebook, Inc.
				acquired Onavo, an Israeli mobile web analytics
				company.[112][113] In February 2014, Facebook, Inc. announced it
				would buy mobile messaging company WhatsApp for US$19 billion in
				cash and stock.[114][115] Later that year, Facebook bought
				Oculus VR for $2.3 billion in cash and stock,[116] which
				released its first consumer virtual reality headset in 2016. In
				late November 2019, Facebook, Inc. announced the acquisition of
				the game developer Beat Games, responsible for developing one of
				that year's most popular VR games, Beat Saber.[117] In Late 2022
				after Facebook Inc rebranded to Meta Platforms Inc, Oculus was
				rebranded to Meta Quest. In May 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced
				it had acquired Giphy for a reported cash price of $400 million.
				It will be integrated with the Instagram team.[118] However, in
				August 2021, UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) stated
				that Facebook, Inc. might have to sell Giphy, after an
				investigation found that the deal between the two companies
				would harm competition in display advertising market.[119]
				Facebook, Inc. was fined $70 million by CMA for deliberately
				failing to report all information regarding the acquisition and
				the ongoing antitrust investigation.[120] In October 2022, the
				CMA ruled for a second time that Meta be required to divest
				Giphy, stating that Meta already controls half of the
				advertising in the UK. Meta agreed to the sale, though it stated
				that it disagrees with the decision itself.[121] In May 2023,
				Giphy was divested to Shutterstock for $53 million.[122] In
				November 2020, Facebook, Inc. announced that it planned to
				purchase the customer-service platform and chatbot specialist
				startup Kustomer to promote companies to use their platform for
				business. It has been reported that Kustomer valued at slightly
				over $1 billion.[123] The deal was closed in February 2022 after
				regulatory approval.[124] In September 2022, Meta acquired
				Lofelt, a Berlin-based haptic tech startup.[125] Lobbying In
				2020, Facebook, Inc. spent $19.7 million on lobbying, hiring 79
				lobbyists. In 2019, it had spent $16.7 million on lobbying and
				had a team of 71 lobbyists, up from $12.6 million and 51
				lobbyists in 2018.[126] Facebook was the largest spender of
				lobbying money among the Big Tech companies in 2020.[127] The
				lobbying team includes top congressional aide John Branscome,
				who was hired in September 2021, to help the company fend off
				threats from Democratic lawmakers and the Biden
				administration.[128] Censorship [icon] This section needs
				expansion. You can help by making an edit request. (October
				2024) In August 2024, Mark Zuckerberg sent a letter to Jim
				Jordan indicating that during the COVID-19 pandemic the Biden
				administration repeatedly asked Meta to limit certain COVID-19
				content, including humor and satire, on Facebook and
				Instagram.[129] Disinformation concerns [icon] This section
				needs expansion. You can help by making an edit request.
				(October 2024) In 2024 Meta's decision to continue to
				disseminate a falsified video of US president Joe Biden, even
				after it had been proven to be fake, attracted criticism and
				concern.[130][131] Lawsuits Main article: Lawsuits involving
				Meta Platforms Numerous lawsuits have been filed against the
				company, both when it was known as Facebook, Inc., and as Meta
				Platforms. In March 2020, the Office of the Australian
				Information Commissioner (OAIC) sued Facebook, for significant
				and persistent infringements of the rule on privacy involving
				the Cambridge Analytica fiasco. Every violation of the Privacy
				Act is subject to a theoretical cumulative liability of $1.7
				million. The OAIC estimated that a total of 311,127 Australians
				had been exposed.[132] On December 8, 2020, the U.S. Federal
				Trade Commission and 46 states (excluding Alabama, Georgia,
				South Carolina, and South Dakota), the District of Columbia and
				the territory of Guam, launched Federal Trade Commission v.
				Facebook as an antitrust lawsuit against Facebook. The lawsuit
				concerns Facebook's acquisition of two competitors—Instagram and
				WhatsApp—and the ensuing monopolistic situation. FTC alleges
				that Facebook holds monopolistic power in the U.S. social
				networking market and seeks to force the company to divest from
				Instagram and WhatsApp to break up the conglomerate.[133]
				William Kovacic, a former chairman of the Federal Trade
				Commission, argued the case will be difficult to win as it would
				require the government to create a counterfactual argument of an
				internet where the Facebook-WhatsApp-Instagram entity did not
				exist, and prove that harmed competition or consumers.[134] On
				December 24, 2021, a court in Russia fined Meta for $27 million
				after the company declined to remove unspecified banned content.
				The fine was reportedly tied to the company's annual revenue in
				the country.[135] Main article: Content moderation and working
				conditions In May 2022, a lawsuit was filed in Kenya against
				Meta and its local outsourcing company Sama. Allegedly, Meta has
				poor working conditions in Kenya for workers moderating Facebook
				posts. According to the lawsuit, 260 screeners were declared
				redundant with confusing reasoning. The lawsuit seeks financial
				compensation and an order that outsourced moderators be given
				the same health benefits and pay scale as Meta
				employees.[136][137] In June 2022, 8 lawsuits were filed across
				the U.S. over the allege that excessive exposure to platforms
				including Facebook and Instagram has led to attempted or actual
				suicides, eating disorders and sleeplessness, among other
				issues. The litigation follows a former Facebook employee's
				testimony in Congress that the company refused to take
				responsibility. The company noted that tools have been developed
				for parents to keep track of their children's activity on
				Instagram and set time limits in addition to Meta's "Take a
				break" reminders. In addition, the company is providing
				resources specific to eating disorders as well as developing AI
				to prevent children under the age of 13 signing up for Facebook
				or Instagram.[138] In June 2022, Meta settled a lawsuit with the
				US Department of Justice. The lawsuit, which was filed in 2019,
				alleged that the company enabled housing discrimination through
				targeted advertising, as it allowed home owners and landlords to
				run housing ads excluding people based on sex, race, religion,
				and other characteristics. The U.S. Department of Justice stated
				that this was in violation of the Fair Housing Act. Meta was
				handed a penalty of $115,054 and given until December 31, 2022,
				to shadow the algorithm tool.[139][140][141] In January 2023,
				Meta was fined €390 million for violations of the European Union
				General Data Protection Regulation.[142] In May 2023, the
				European Data Protection Board fined Meta a record €1.2 billion
				for breaching European Union data privacy laws by transferring
				personal data of Facebook users to servers in the U.S.[143] In
				July 2024, Meta agreed to pay the state of Texas $1.4 billion to
				settle a lawsuit brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton
				accusing the company of collecting users' biometric data without
				consent, setting a record for the largest privacy-related
				settlement ever obtained by a state attorney general.[144] In
				October 2024, Meta Platforms faced lawsuits in Japan from 30
				plaintiffs who claimed they were defrauded by fake investment
				ads on Facebook and Instagram, featuring false celebrity
				endorsements. The plaintiffs are seeking approximately 2.8
				million dollars in damages.[145] Structure Mark Zuckerberg,
				co-founder, chairman and CEO of Meta, in 2012 Management Meta's
				key management consists of:[146][147] Mark Zuckerberg, chairman
				and chief executive officer Javier Olivan, chief operating
				officer Sir Nick Clegg, president, global affairs Susan Li,
				chief financial officer Andrew Bosworth, chief technology
				officer David Wehner, chief strategy officer Chris Cox, chief
				product officer Jennifer Newstead, chief legal officer As of
				October 2022, Meta had 83,553 employees worldwide. Board of
				directors As of June 2024, Meta's board consisted of the
				following directors;[148] Mark Zuckerberg (chairman, co-founder,
				controlling shareholder, and chief executive officer) Peggy
				Alford (non-executive director, executive vice president, global
				sales, PayPal) Marc Andreessen (non-executive director,
				co-founder and general partner, Andreessen Horowitz) Drew
				Houston (non-executive director, chairman and chief executive
				officer, Dropbox) Nancy Killefer (non-executive director, senior
				partner, McKinsey & Company) Robert M. Kimmitt (non-executive
				director, senior international counsel, WilmerHale) Tracey
				Travis (non-executive director, executive vice president, chief
				financial officer, Estée Lauder Companies) Tony Xu
				(non-executive director, chairman and chief executive officer,
				DoorDash) Hock Tan (CEO of Broadcom) [149] John D. Arnold
				(former Enron executive) [149] Company governance Roger McNamee,
				an early Facebook investor and Zuckerberg's former mentor, said
				Facebook had "the most centralized decision-making structure I
				have ever encountered in a large company".[150] Facebook
				co-founder Chris Hughes has stated that chief executive officer
				Mark Zuckerberg has too much power, that the company is now a
				monopoly, and that, as a result, it should be split into
				multiple smaller companies. In an op-ed in The New York Times,
				Hughes said he was concerned that Zuckerberg had surrounded
				himself with a team that did not challenge him, and that it is
				the U.S. government's job to hold him accountable and curb his
				"unchecked power".[151] He also said that "Mark's power is
				unprecedented and un-American."[152] Several U.S. politicians
				agreed with Hughes.[153] European Union Commissioner for
				Competition Margrethe Vestager stated that splitting Facebook
				should be done only as "a remedy of the very last resort", and
				that it would not solve Facebook's underlying problems.[154]
